# QuickMath

This repo contains some quick math. The repo contains a series of prototype scripts I have written for a variety of different projects and interests. They are not intended to be robust or reused, but occassionally the output is saved when interesting.

Some of the projects in this repo include:

1. Code to execute `lsqnonneg` in Python
2. Some code exploring persistent homology and the topology of data
3. Dyanmics of regulatory networks
